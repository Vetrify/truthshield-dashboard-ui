This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with `wunderctl init`


## Dev notes

I'm getting the following error when running 'tsc --noEmit --incremental false' via `yarn typecheck` which causes the build to fail

```TS2559: Type '{ children: Element; }' has no properties in common with type 'IntrinsicAttributes & Props'.

<WunderGraphProvider>```

to fix it, I have to update the autogenerated code in provider.tsx to include the children on Props

```export interface Props {
    endpoint?: string;
    children?: React.ReactNode;
    extraHeaders?: { [key: string]: string };
    customFetch?: (input: RequestInfo, init?: RequestInit) => Promise<globalThis.Response>;
}```

I have updated the wundergraph team and they are going to fix it in the next release. - MC - 2022-05-16


## Getting Started

Install the dependencies:

```shell
npm install
# or
yarn
```

Then, start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
